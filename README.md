# Welcome to the CapIntel Live Coding Exercise!
This project is a sample repository containing the main dependency that you will be using during the test. These instructions will help you be ready for the test by explaining what to expect.

## Why live coding? 
Our goal is to build the strongest development team possible. We know live coding can be stressful and this exercise is designed to demonstrate a realistic problem you would encounter in the role. We will use this session to learn more about your technical skills, and your approach problem solving. Please email tande@capintel.com if you require any accommodations for your pair programming session.

## How to prepare
Here are a few important elements to prepare before your live coding session.

### Install VS Code
We recommend installing VS Code (or any IDE you prefer for the MERN stack). Please note: this exercise will not involve Mongo and setting up a Mongo server is not required.

### Install node
The latest version that we've tested this code with is v18.20.1

### Run the front and back projects
Those are vanilla Express and React projects using node. Simply go in the subfolder, enter the commands, and you should have a server running:

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
You should then be able to open your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) and see a small React home page.

```
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```
You should then be able to open you browser to [localhost:5500](http://localhost:5500/) and see a small Express home page.

## What is the content of the live coding exercise?
We've created a codebase with the same structure that you have in this repository. You're going to have a small backend (Express) with a small frontend (React). The application is a simple view to see the performance of financial instruments.

## Learn a few basic financial concepts

### What to expect

#### Adding new features
You will need to add new features on the existing code.

#### Refactoring
Sadly, the application builder had multiple mistakes while developing the application in both the front and back end. Some of those errors are structural, some of them are bugs, and some of them are UX flaws. Throughout the exercise, we encourage you to tackle those while you are coding a new feature or when you spot them. The most important thing is to communicate with your interviewer that you've spotted something and then explain your logic for why you chose to fix it right away or to postpone it later in the session.

#### Interviewer interactions
The interviewer is there to help you understand the exercise, answer questions and to share ideas with. The person is not there to trick you or mislead you.

#### What am I allowed to use
You can use anything you want (including AI). However, you are responsible for everything that you produce. The interviewer may ask you questions about your code; if you are not able to answer questions or provide an explanation, it will impact the result of your session.

#### How will you be assessed?
- **Refactoring efforts coverage**: As stated above, we expect to either identify and acknowledge or fix some of the issues you see. If you choose to identify and acknowledge, let the interviewer know why you are making this decision.
- **New feature implementation**: You should be able to implement new features in the application. Your implementation and design of the features will be evaluated (this will be relative as we acknowledge this is a time-boxed session)  
- **Software best practices**: We will evaluate the work accomplished against the software development best practices. As discussed above, the project was badly built on purpose and best practices weren't applied. As you're going through the exercise, take time to discuss best practices with your interviewer and what changes and improvements you would like to make.

### Agenda for the session
1. Join the Microsoft Teams Video link that is in your calendar invite. Be sure to double check your tech before joining. 
2. Your interviewer will introduce themselves and share an additional git repository with the complete codebase for 5 minutes.
3. When you have reviewed the file, the exercise will formally begin. We ask that you share your desktop via Microsoft Teams. Please ensure that any irrelevant tabs or applications are closed before your session. If you have not shared your screen via Microsoft Teams before and are using a Mac, you will need to grant the necessary permissions before your session. [Instructions for sharing your screen via Microsoft Teams can be found here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/share-content-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-fcc2bf59-aecd-4481-8f99-ce55dd836ce8).
4. Your interviewer will be keeping track of time. The session will be booked for 75 minutes to ensure you have time to review and work through the exercise
5. Once the session is complete, your interviewer will ask if you have any outstanding questions. You can expect to hear back about your candidacy us within 5 business days of your live coding session.
